To be able to run following codes, you first need to compile them.

Usually you just put in your terminal:

	gcc code.c --output code.bin [--etc further optimization flags]

Where the --output name maybe be chosen by yourself in a purposefully manner.

To make live more easy, we offload this command into a bash (bash is a Shell program in Linux, under different OS's it is called different) script, such as the "compile.sh" you see. Look inside and see what is written in there.
This bash script, needs to be made runnable first with the following command:
	
	chmod u+x compile.sh

If the script is runnable in the first place without issuing that command, you have a security problem on your computer.

Then just issue the compiled code with "./code.bin" .
