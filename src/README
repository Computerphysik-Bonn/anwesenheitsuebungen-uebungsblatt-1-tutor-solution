To be able to run following codes, you first need to compile them.

Usually you just put in your terminal:

	gcc code.c --output code.bin [--etc further optimization flags]

Where the --output name maybe be chosen by yourself in a purposefully manner.

To make live more easy, we offload this command into a bash (bash is a Shell program in Linux, under different OS's it is called different) script, such as the "compile.sh" you see. Look inside and see what is written in there.
This bash script, needs to be made runnable first with the following command:
	
	chmod u+x compile.sh

If the script is runnable in the first place without issuing that command, you have a security problem on your computer.

Then just issue the compiled code with "./code.bin" .

As you can see, you have many compilation scripts in this folder. To vertain degree or complexity of your project it is okey to just have a compilation script. But maybe for clearer handling some chose to use Makefiles, where you can have one file and put there many compilation possibilieties and options into it. 
You can clearly do this too with a bash script, but here you have clear organisation off all.

Use
	make option

For using one of the compilation options you have. Look into the file and see what kind of options there are. They are denoted as "read", "debug" and so on.
So
	make read

Would compile the program where it just reads from the dataset1.
